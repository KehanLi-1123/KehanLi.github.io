Hi, I’m [Kehan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kehanli/). Welcome to my personal website — a space where I introduce myself and share my research and thoughts.

My work and research

Financial market; Macro; Probability and statistics.

My background and history
------
Currently, I live in London, UK. I was born in Guizhou, China. From 2007 to 2011, I studied Applied Mathematics in Tianjin, China, where I spent much of my time re-proving classical mathematical theorems established over the past three centuries, such as the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem and the Central Limit Theorem. In September 2012, I moved to Bielefeld, Germany to study Mathematical Economics for three months. After that, I spent almost five years in Paris, France, conducting research in quantitative finance and defended my PhD in June 2017. Oui, j’étais Parisien, coding math models in Matlab, R, and Python; diving into the Musée d’Orsay, Église Saint-Sulpice, and Jardin du Luxembourg when the weather was good; and walking along the Seine in the 5e arrondissement whenever I was blocked by a math problem.

Upon graduation, I joined Goldman Sachs in London, UK as a quant in the Finance Division, where I focused on coding models and building infrastructure for the independent valuation of fixed-income derivatives, using consensus prices of standard instruments and broker quotes. Yes, I have been coding in Slang and SecDB on a day-to-day basis for seven years. I left Goldman in May 2024 and have since taken a career break. During this time, I’ve focused on being a family man while also exploring areas such as pricing derivatives and trading U.S. equities and options. Since then, I’ve been coding in Python. Now I am actively seeking new opportunities.

I began teaching in September 2012, serving as a tutor for the Optimization course at Universität Bielefeld whenever the postdoctoral instructor was unavailable. I officially concluded my teaching at  Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne in June 2017. However, during my time at Goldman, I continued teaching by coaching junior quants across the New York, London, and Bengaluru offices of the Fixed Income Valuation team, and by educating non-quant colleagues in the EMEA Product Control team.

I am a basketball player with strong strategic thinking. I am willing to take risks and responsibility by making critical shots or passing the ball to teammates, depending on the team's optimal positioning and scoring opportunity. I am also a sabre fencer who blends distance and timing; a rational risk-taking snowboarder; a pianist expressing myself, and discovering patterns in sheet music; a passionate art collector of paintings, ceramics, and sculptures — particularly Chinese and French works. I use a graphical, mathematical, pedagogical approach to teach young children piano performance and music theory. I am also the father of a lovely six-year-old girl.
