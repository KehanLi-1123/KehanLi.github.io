Hi! I’m [Kehan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kehanli/). Welcome to my personal website!

My work and research
------
Financial market; Macro; Probability and statistics.

My background and history
------
Currently, I live in London, UK. I was born in Guizhou, China, and from 2007 to 2011 I studied Applied Mathematics in Tianjin, China. In September 2012, I moved to Bielefeld, Germany to study Mathematical Economics for three months. After that, I spent almost five years in Paris, France, conducting research in quantitative finance and defended my PhD in June 2017. Oui, j’étais Parisien.
======
Upon graduation, I joined Goldman Sachs in London, UK as a Quantitative Analyst in the Finance Division, where I focused on coding models and building infrastructure for the independent valuation of fixed-income derivatives, using consensus prices of standard instruments and broker quotes. I left Goldman Sachs in May 2024 and have since taken a career break, during which I’ve explored various areas such as pricing derivatives and trading U.S. equities. I am actively seeking new opportunities.
======
I am a basketball player with strong teamwork and strategic thinking; a sabre fencer who blends distance and timing; a risk-taking snowboarder; a pianist discovering patterns in sheet music; and a passionate art collector of paintings, ceramics, and sculptures—particularly French and Chinese works. I am also the father of a lovely six-year-old girl.
