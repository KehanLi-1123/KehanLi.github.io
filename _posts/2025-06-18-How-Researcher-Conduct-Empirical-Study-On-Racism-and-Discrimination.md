# 🧠 How Do Researchers Measure Racism and Discrimination?

Measuring attitudes like racism and discrimination is inherently difficult. These are **latent constructs**—internal beliefs and motivations that are **not directly observable**. People may also **hide or distort their true views** due to social pressure, making it harder to collect accurate data.

This post explains how researchers attempt to measure such sensitive topics, based on a large-scale study involving over 910,000 people.

## 1. 📝 Self-Report Scales

Most studies use **standardized questionnaires** to capture explicit attitudes. These are called **self-report scales**. Common examples include:

- *Modern Racism Scale*
- *Symbolic Racism 2000 Scale*
- *Social Dominance Orientation*

Participants respond to statements using a **Likert scale**, such as from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree.”

**Example items:**
> “Racial minorities have received more than their fair share of economic resources.”  
> “I would be uncomfortable if a Black family moved in next door.”

Researchers score these responses to assess levels of explicit racial bias.

## 2. ⚡ Implicit Measures (IAT)

To get around self-censorship, researchers often use **indirect tools** like the **Implicit Association Test (IAT)**.

This test measures how quickly people associate concepts like "good" or "bad" with different racial categories (e.g., White vs. Black faces).

The assumption is that **faster reaction times** for certain associations reflect **stronger unconscious biases**, even if someone denies being prejudiced.

## 3. 🔧 Scale Evaluation with IRT and CFA

After data collection, researchers use advanced tools to assess **how well the scale works**.

- **Item Response Theory (IRT)** checks whether each question effectively distinguishes between low and high levels of racism.
- **Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)** and **fit indices** (like RMSEA, CFI) evaluate whether all items consistently measure the same underlying trait.
- They also test for **floor or ceiling effects**—i.e., whether most participants score extremely low or high, making it hard to tell people apart.

## 4. 🧭 Nomological Network Analysis

Researchers also study how racism scales correlate with other psychological traits. This is known as mapping a **nomological network**.

For example, if a racism scale correlates with political ideology, social conservatism, or empathy (as theory predicts), it likely measures a meaningful construct.

However, if multiple scales show **almost identical patterns**, they might not be capturing distinct dimensions of prejudice. Theoretical overlap is a major concern.

## 5. 🌍 Massive Data Sets

The study referenced used **data from over 910,000 people**, likely gathered through:

- Online survey platforms (e.g., Project Implicit)
- University research pools
- Crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., MTurk, Prolific)

Large sample sizes help with statistical power, but they also **amplify issues with poor measurement**—flawed scales can yield misleading results on a large scale.

## ⚠️ Limitations and Recommendations

- People may not report their true attitudes (social desirability bias).
- Some scales are **internally consistent** but fail to reflect the full range of beliefs.
- The field is **crowded with overlapping scales**, many of which need updating.

Researchers recommend both **careful selection** of validated instruments and **renovation** of older scales to ensure accuracy in the study of prejudice.
