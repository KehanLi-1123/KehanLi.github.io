It seems that racism, along with other forms of discrimination, is embedded in human cognition rather than being merely an ad hoc phenomenon. Fundamentally, it is a way of distinguishing between ‚ÄúI‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúothers.‚Äù Suppose we assign a number from -1 to 1 to represent a person's attitude toward others‚Äîwhere 1 means extremely kind and -1 indicates extreme racism or discrimination. In that case, the distribution of attitudes across a population may follow a bell-shaped curve, such as a Gaussian distribution. This implies that within the overall population, most people would cluster around the neutral middle‚Äîneither particularly kind nor overtly racist‚Äîwhile some individuals would fall into the left tail (representing stronger racist tendencies) and others into the right tail (representing greater kindness).

Unfortunately, as one can imagine, it would be very difficult to conduct an empirical study to test this assumption or model, due to the challenge of collecting reliable data on people's attitudes toward others. Individuals may not express their true opinions in surveys, and those who hold discriminatory views may not even perceive themselves as discriminatory.

If one accepts the argument that a certain degree of discrimination is ingrained in human cognition as a result of evolutionary development, then it is not surprising to observe that teenagers may sometimes exhibit more discriminatory behavior than adults. This can be attributed to their limited life experience, reduced exposure to diverse people and cultures, and a lack of education.

Racism and regional discrimination are not merely social issues ‚Äî they are deeply rooted in how the human brain processes information, identity, and fear. By exploring the **psychological mechanisms** behind such behaviors, we can better understand not only why discrimination happens, but also how to reduce it.

## üß† 1. In-group vs. Out-group Psychology

Humans evolved in small tribal groups, where survival often depended on **cooperation within the group** and **vigilance against outsiders**. This wiring persists today:

- We tend to **favor those who are "like us"** (in-group).
- We may feel suspicion or discomfort toward **those who are different** (out-group).

This tendency is not inherently evil ‚Äî but in modern society, it can become the root of **xenophobia**, **racism**, or **regional bias**.

> **Example:** Favoring people from your hometown while distrusting those from another region.

## üß† 2. Stereotyping and Mental Shortcuts

Our brains constantly use **cognitive shortcuts** to make sense of the world. Stereotypes are one such shortcut: simplified generalizations about groups of people.

- They reduce complexity but **distort reality**.
- Once formed, they become **self-reinforcing** ‚Äî we notice things that confirm the stereotype and ignore what contradicts it.

> **Example:** ‚ÄúPeople from region X are lazy‚Äù ‚Äî despite having no basis or being contradicted by evidence.

## üß† 3. Social Learning: We Are Taught to Discriminate

No one is born racist. Children **learn prejudices** from:

- Parents
- Friends
- Media
- Institutional systems

Casual racist jokes, offhand remarks, or repeated stereotypes in TV or online platforms subtly **normalize discrimination** over time.

---

## üß† 4. Scapegoating and Displacement

When people feel powerless, anxious, or under threat, they often **displace blame** onto convenient targets ‚Äî usually minority or outsider groups. This is known as **scapegoating**.

> **Example:** During economic downturns, immigrants are blamed for "stealing jobs."

This is more about **emotional release** than rational thought.

---

## üß† 5. The Need for Superiority and Belonging

Humans seek **identity and meaning** in groups. For some, self-worth is tied to the **status of their group**. Discriminating against others becomes a way to:

- Reinforce in-group pride
- Elevate one's self-image by **putting others down**

This is common in people with **low self-esteem or insecurity**.

---

## üß† 6. Fear of the Unfamiliar

Many biases stem from **lack of exposure**. People who haven‚Äôt meaningfully interacted with other cultures or regions may feel:

- Uncertain
- Suspicious
- Threatened

These feelings can **evolve into prejudice** if not challenged.

> **Example:** Assuming someone is untrustworthy or strange simply because they speak with a different accent.

## üõ†Ô∏è What Can We Do?

While these biases may arise from natural human tendencies, they are **not fixed**. Prejudices can be unlearned and reduced through:

- **Education**: Understanding history and systemic discrimination
- **Exposure**: Interacting with people from different backgrounds
- **Empathy**: Listening to others‚Äô stories and experiences
- **Accountability**: Calling out bias ‚Äî in others and ourselves

We all have blind spots. Recognizing that is the first step toward building a more inclusive and fair society.
