It seems prejudice and discrimination often stem from making quick judgments about a person based on macro-level characteristics such as race, gender, nationality, wealth, education level, or hometown (or home country). While it is true that an individual’s behavior and personality can be influenced by these macro-level factors, I would like to emphasize the importance of micro-level information—such as one’s family background and childhood experiences, or even some random events in his life—in understanding a person more fully.

To help and remind people to fully understand individuals—and thereby reduce the chances of prejudice and discrimination—I’d like to introduce two models. Currently, these two models are more qualitative than quantitative.

## 1. A two factor model
We define the two factor model as following:

$$
I = \beta \cdot S + \alpha
$$

Here, \( I \) denotes the behavior and character of an individual, while \( S \) represents the average behavior and character of the society to which this individual belongs. This society can be defined by criteria such as nationality, region, or religion. It constitutes the first factor. The term \( \alpha \) reflects the unique characteristics and behavior of the individual, which is the second factor. Based on this model each individual's behavior and character can be divided and attributed to the social factor and an \( \alpha \) factor.

An analogy of the two factor model here is the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which was introduced by Jack Treynor (1961, 1962),[4] William F. Sharpe (1964), John Lintner (1965a,b) and Jan Mossin (1966) independently, building on the earlier work of Harry Markowitz on diversification and modern portfolio theory.
