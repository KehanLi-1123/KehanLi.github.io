It seems prejudice and discrimination often stem from making quick judgments about a person based on macro-level characteristics such as race, gender, nationality, wealth, education level, or hometown (or home country). While it is true that an individual’s behavior and personality can be influenced by these macro-level factors, I would like to emphasize the importance of micro-level information—such as one’s family background and childhood experiences, or even some random events in his life—in understanding a person more fully.

To help and remind people to fully understand individuals—and thereby reduce the chances of prejudice and discrimination—I’d like to introduce two models. Currently, these two models are more qualitative than quantitative.

## 1. A two-factor model
We define the two-factor model as follows:

$$
I = \beta \cdot S + \alpha
$$

Here, \( I \) denotes the behavior and character of an individual, while \( S \) represents the average behavior and character of the society to which this individual belongs. This society can be defined by criteria such as nationality, region, or religion. It constitutes the first factor. The term \( \alpha \) reflects the unique characteristics and behavior of the individual, which is the second factor. Based on this model each individual's behavior and character can be divided and attributed to the social factor and an \( \alpha \) factor.

An analogy to the two-factor model is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which was independently developed by Jack Treynor (1961, 1962), William F. Sharpe (1964), John Lintner (1965a, 1965b), and Jan Mossin (1966), building on Harry Markowitz’s earlier work on diversification and modern portfolio theory.

## 2. A multi-factor model
To further understand an individual's behavior and character, we define the multi-factor model as follows:

$$
I = \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i F_i + \alpha
$$

Here, \( I \) denotes the behavior and character of an individual, and \( F_i \) represents a factor or piece of information associated with this individual, such as race, gender, age, nationality, hometown (or home country), wealth, or education. In this model, we attribute an individual's behavior and character to a set of macro factors \( \{F_i\}_{i=1,\dots,n} \). 

We may observe that in most cases, \( \alpha \) is not zero, indicating that there are micro, subtle, and highly personal influences that cannot be fully captured by those macro factors.

## 3. Real-Life Example of \( \alpha \)
Those with certain life experiences and observations might notice that even full siblings can have completely different characters and behaviors, despite sharing most of the same macro factors — including their genes.
